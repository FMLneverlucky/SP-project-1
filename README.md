Power Ups will spawn with a random chance in both game modes.
Just walk over it to pick it up!
Picking up the power up will turn your cough projectiles lethal for a short period of time.
During this period, NPCs hit by your projectiles will be killed, making your escape easier.
Do look out for the bright green and yellow!

-Police 
Police are a type of NPC that turn hostile once the player coughs, regardless of where you are!
They cannot be killed by lethal projectiles and do not despawn in Endless mode.
Do look out for their bright blue colour!

-CCTV
CCTVs will be watching over a certain area of the map, rotating in direction every 2 seconds.
You will see them appear from Level 3 onwards in Normal mode, and 5 of them in Endless mode.
Coughing under their radar will lead to an instant Game Over so be careful not to cough under their line of sight!


Tips to playing the game
------------------------

- Pick up power up to turn cough projectiles lethal. Shooting lethal projectiles at civilians will kill them.
- Avoid coughing within a CCTV's range unless necessary. Coughing under the CCTV's radar will lead to an instant game over.
- Watch your surroundings for nearby police officers. They are fast and will start chasing you immediately after you cough. Being caught by police will also lead to a game over.
- Be prepared for the unexpected in Endless Mode.
- Have fun!
